<h4>1. Get the ball rolling.</h4>

  Nobody likes to be first. That’s why it’s always a good idea to get your fundraising off to a good start by making the first contribution (and if possible, a generous one). This will make others more likely to get involved. In addition, showing the amount donated with help people have a reference on how much people are giving.

<h4>2. Tell people WHY it matters.</h4>

<div class="tip__content"><img alt="" src="https://libs.iraiser.eu/users/unrwa-p2p/public/assets/images/icons/icon_email@2x.png" />
<p>We’ve put together an <span class="highlight-blue-inline">email template you can download</span> to help you get started. The most important thing you can add to this message is the WHY you are fundraising. Let your family and friends know why this matters to you – that’s what they care about most!</p></div>

<h4>3. Start with your close contacts.</h4>

<div class="tip__content"><img alt="" src="https://libs.iraiser.eu/users/unrwa-p2p/public/assets/images/icons/icon_network@2x.png" />
<p>It’s always best to start by emailing your close contacts because they are the most likely to donate. Try sending some quick personal messages to your inner circle to build up some momentum. Then use the email template you customized to reach all of your other contacts.</p></div>

<h4>4. Now move to social media.</h4>

<p>
  Once you’ve sent your first batch of emails out, it’s time to turn to social media. One of the best strategies is to use platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to tag and thank people that have already donated. This spreads your message further and lets the people you are asking to donate know that others are already getting behind you. And don’t forget the power of an image.</p></div>

<h4>5. Re-engage with email.</h4>

<div class="tip__content"><img alt="" src="https://libs.iraiser.eu/users/unrwa-p2p/public/assets/images/icons/icon_discuss@2x.png" />
<p>
Don’t hesitate to send a few follow up emails. Emails are easy to overlook, and people often open them up quickly and then forget to go back to them. Use email to keep people up to date with your progress as you hit different milestones (50% raised, 75% raised, etc.) and ask supporters to help you hit the next milestone.

<h4>6. Continue thanking and updating.</h4>

<div class="tip__content"><img alt="" src="https://libs.iraiser.eu/users/unrwa-p2p/public/assets/images/icons/icon_hearth@2x.png" />
<p>As more of your network gets behind you, keep thanking them on social media and make sure you continue to share your progress towards your goal.</p></div>
