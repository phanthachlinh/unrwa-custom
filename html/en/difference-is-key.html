<h2>INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAMP IMPROVEMENT</h2>

<p>Of the some 5 million Palestine refugees registered with our Agency, roughly one third live in 58 recognized refugee camps. Over the years, these camps have transformed from temporary &#39;tent cities&#39; into hyper-congested masses of multi-storey buildings with narrow alleys, characterized by high concentrations of poverty and extreme overcrowding. We adopt an integrated, comprehensive, participatory and community-driven improvement of the built environment of Palestine refugee camps, utilizing urban planning tools.</p>
